# PatternScan

My first github project, my mum would be so proud.

Initially I made a External Pattern Scan Youtube Tutorial and the project has been evolving the past few weeks.

The code is for Part 2 of this Youtube Tutorial and contains code intended for teaching beginners.  I also include code to showcase tips and tricks I have to share that may not relate to the core purpose of this project.
