My first github project, my mum would be so proud.

Fleep made an Internal Pattern Scan Tutorial here:

Initially I made an External Pattern Scan Youtube Tutorial to compliment his tutorial.

The project has been evolving the past few weeks and I decided to finally make a github.

The code is for Part 2 of this Youtube Tutorial and contains code intended for teaching beginners.  I also include code to showcase tips and tricks I have to share that may not relate to the core purpose of this project.

Shoutout to my friend Solaire, some of this code inspired by his holiness
